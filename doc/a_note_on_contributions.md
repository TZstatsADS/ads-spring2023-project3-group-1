Project 3 Group 1

Team members: Zixun Zhang, Wen Chen, Chenyi Jiang, Hongju Ouyang, Han Wang, Ashwathi Prakash Nair

Summary: In this project, we developed a CNN model to predict the label of images. We cleaned the noisy labels and use all 50000 images to train our CNN model. We tuned the hyperparameters to get the best testing results.

All group members collectively designed the study. Zixun, Wen and Ashwathi developed Model I and the hyperparameter tuner for evaluation. Hongju developed Model II and Chenyi and Han worked on testing and integrating the 2 models. All team members contributed to the GitHub repository and prepared the presentation. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
